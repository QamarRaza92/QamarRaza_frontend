# Product Inventory Dashboard

## About This Project
This is my Product Inventory Dashboard. I created this project entirely from scratch using just regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used core html and css to built this project

Basically, here you can manage product list. The updataion on th dashboard is also kind of smooth which enhances user visuals. Also i also used 'localStorage' to save data from being erased.

## Features developed:
* Fake API Delay: The js 'setTimeout' was used here along with js promises to show a "Loading..." screen initially when the site is
opened.

* Dynamic Cards: I did not write product cards in HTML. UI is generated dynamically by my js code.

* Search & Filters: - UpperCase and LowerCase are ignored while searching in the search bar.
  - To sort items, i added a category dropdown.
  - Also there is a "Low Stock" button to quickly filters out items with a stock count of less than 5.

* Sorting: We can arrange the product by price or in alphabetical order.

* Live Stats: The secction on top would act a mini-dashboard. We can see total inventory items and total price in the beginning.

* Adding/Deleting: There is also an option to either add or delete new product. 

## How to test it
It's easy to run as no server setup is required.
1. First try to download the or clone the folder.
2. Then move to 'product_inventory_dashboard' folder.
3. Now need to open the index.html file.
